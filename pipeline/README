This is a pipepline for Jenkins

It will be built on a jenkins slave node called "builder"

That node needs AWS credentials and aws-cli with ECS, ECR(aws docker registry) and EC2 access.

This pipeline must receive a variable named "Service" which value is the name of the service to deploy. The Service configurations (Dockerfile) comes
from a directory in the GitHub repo "flaviomoringa/ecs/<Service>/container"

For the ecs deploy it uses the command "ecs-deploy" (https://github.com/silinternational/ecs-deploy) that does a "blue/green" deploy of the service on the ECS Cluster. Meaning if the healtcheck of the Service fails it will rollback to the previous version.

It also sends build information to a slack channel (depends on the slack plugin being installed and configured on Jenkins)
